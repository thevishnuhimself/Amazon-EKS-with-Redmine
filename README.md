**Hola People,**

              In this project, I have launched an issue tracking tool REDMINE Architecture on Amazon EKS. Redmine is a free and open-source, web-based project management, and issue tracking tool. It allows users to manage multiple projects and associated subprojects. It features per project wikis and forums, time tracking, and flexible role-based access control. It includes a calendar and Gantt charts to aid visual representation of projects and their deadlines. Redmine integrates with various version control systems and includes a repository browser and diff viewer. famous open-source blogging platform used widely by independent journalists & writers across the globe.
